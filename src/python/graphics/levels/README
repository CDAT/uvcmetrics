This directory contains files related to making the ncar levels available to the python app.
In particular metadiags.  The key file is plot_surfaces_cons.py which was derived from 
plot_surfaces_cons.ncl.  It was created as a copy with the appropriate edit.  The ncl file
contains lots of other stuff such as model-model comparision levels and other logic which
has NOT been incorporated.  The next time there is bitching about the levels, the poor 
sucker to make changes will probaly have to change all of this massive disgusting kludge!
